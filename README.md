## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate ML learner currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Applications from IGDTUW. I specialize in hands-on machine learning projects and love exploring real-world applications of AI. My current focus lies in:

- 🤖 Deep Learning (CNNs, transfer learning)
- 📊 Time Series Forecasting (SARIMAX, EDA)
- 🔍 Computer Vision & OCR
- 💬 NLP & LLMs (transformers, BERT fine-tuning)

I'm actively trying to learn through open-source communities like **Hugging Face** and participating in programs like **GSSoC'25** to grow as a developer and collaborator.
